# Approval gates only high-impact actions; three policy tiers; request-changes is a revise loop

ADR 0005 made Operators the human quality layer. That could have meant "a human reviews every AI deliverable before the customer sees it." It does not. We gate only what has **real, outward, hard-to-reverse impact** — the rest flows straight to the customer.

**Decision:**

- **Gate scope.** `require-approval` is reserved for actions that leave the system or can't be cheaply undone: publishing a post, sending an email, scheduling a go-live, spending ad budget. Pure **deliverables** — a generated image, copy, a research brief, any internal artifact — `auto-execute`: they land in the customer's chat / asset library with no blocking review. Vetting everything would bury the operator and slow the customer for little gain; we vet what matters.

- **Three policy tiers**, declared per action-type on the producing agent's template (`default_policies`):
  - **auto-execute** — runs immediately, nobody notified (deliverables, internal work).
  - **notify-only** — runs immediately (non-blocking) but is surfaced to an operator feed for after-the-fact spot-check / audit. The home for "lighter-touch monitoring."
  - **require-approval** — blocks on the Workflow's `waitForEvent("decision-<id>")` until an operator decides.

- **Gated actions are discipline-routed** to the matching operator (ADR 0005): a `publish_post` from the Designer's work reaches the design reviewer, etc.

- **Decision outcomes:**
  - **approve** → the action executes; the deliverable is released to the customer.
  - **reject** → the ticket terminates; nothing ships.
  - **request-changes** → a **revise loop**: the operator's written feedback goes back to the **Worker agent**, which regenerates and re-proposes; operator and agent iterate until approve or reject. The loop is **operator↔agent** — the customer sees only the final approved result in chat, never the back-and-forth.

## Consequences

- The Workflow must **loop** on `request-changes` rather than terminate. Today it resolves cleanly only on approve/reject; the revise loop (feed feedback → re-generate → re-propose → wait again) is a follow-up.
- A **soft cap** (max revise rounds / cost budget) guards against an unbounded loop; the operator can always reject to end it.
- **notify-only** needs a real destination — an operator monitoring feed distinct from the blocking queue. The activity log exists; surfacing notify-only there (or a dedicated feed) is a follow-up; it's currently unused in templates.
- Which action-types are impactful is a per-template `default_policies` decision, overridable per-company later if needed.
