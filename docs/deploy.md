# Deploying Qolmeia to production

The single source of truth for taking Qolmeia live. Deploys are **manual** today
(no CD pipeline). The dev `.localhost` / portless proxy is **dev-only**; prod
uses real subdomains of one parent and a cross-subdomain session cookie
(ADR 0008).

## 1. The stack at a glance

| App               | Package       | Runtime                                                      | Host                     | Prod subdomain       |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `apps/api`        | `api`         | Hono on Node 24 (tsdown → `node dist/index.mjs`)             | **Railway** (+ Postgres) | `api.qolmeia.com`    |
| `apps/agents`     | `worker-bees` | Cloudflare Worker (DO, Workflows, Prisma, R2, KV, Vectorize) | **Cloudflare**           | `agents.qolmeia.com` |
| `apps/web`        | `web`         | Next.js 16                                                   | **Vercel**               | `app.qolmeia.com`    |
| `apps/backoffice` | `backoffice`  | Next.js 16                                                   | **Vercel**               | `admin.qolmeia.com`  |
| `apps/landing`    | `landing`     | Next.js 16 (static marketing site)                           | **Vercel**               | `www.qolmeia.com`    |

Postgres holds Better Auth and product data (company, ticket, action, asset,
team, memory_fact, …), accessed through Prisma from both the API and Worker.
Binary assets live in **R2**, the session cache in **KV**, and semantic agent
memory in **Vectorize**.

See [`docs/agent-tools.md`](./agent-tools.md) for the full agent-integration
catalog (current tools and which agent uses each).

## 3. Domains + the cross-subdomain cookie (ADR 0008)

Everything lives under **`qolmeia.com`**: `www.` (landing), `app.` (web),
`admin.` (backoffice), `api.` (the Railway api service, which is where Better
Auth runs), `agents.` (the Cloudflare Worker). The session is one cookie on the
`.qolmeia.com` parent so every subdomain sends it:

- `apps/api` sets `COOKIE_DOMAIN=.qolmeia.com` → Better Auth writes the cookie
  on the parent (the `crossSubDomainCookies` config, gated on that env).
- `CORS_ORIGINS` (auth) and `CLIENT_ORIGINS` (Worker) list the real app
  subdomains; browser calls use `credentials: include`.
- The Next apps call auth and the Worker **directly** at their subdomains
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENTS_URL`); no proxy hop.

## 4. Cloudflare Worker: `apps/agents`

> All commands run from `apps/agents/`. First `wrangler login` (or set
> `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).

### 4a. Provision resources

```bash
wrangler r2 bucket create qolmeia-assets
wrangler kv namespace create qolmeia-sessions           # → copy id
wrangler vectorize create qolmeia-memory-qwen3 --dimensions=1024 --metric=cosine
wrangler vectorize create-metadata-index qolmeia-memory-qwen3 --property-name=agentInstanceId --type=string
```

In the Cloudflare dashboard: create an **AI Gateway** named `qolmeia`, and note
your **account id** (`wrangler whoami`).

### 4b. Fill `wrangler.jsonc`

Replace every `PLACEHOLDER`:

- the KV `id` (`SESSIONS`)
- `AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` (your account id)

Update the `vars` for prod:

- `WORKER_PUBLIC_URL=https://agents.qolmeia.com`
- `AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://api.qolmeia.com` (var name kept; auth is one feature of the api service)
- `CLIENT_ORIGINS=https://app.qolmeia.com,https://admin.qolmeia.com`

Uncomment the **prod-only** block at the bottom of `wrangler.jsonc` (custom
domain route + the `ai` and `vectorize` bindings). Without `ai`+`vectorize` the
Worker still runs, but agent **Memory** degrades to an in-process store that's
lost on DO eviction.

### 4c. Set secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL            # shared Postgres connection string
wrangler secret put ASSETS_SIGNING_KEY      # openssl rand -hex 32
wrangler secret put INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET  # MUST match apps/api
wrangler secret put EXA_API_KEY             # optional (webSearch skill)
wrangler secret put FIRECRAWL_API_KEY       # optional (fetchUrl skill)
```

### 4d. Initialize Postgres

For an existing deployment, follow [the model upgrade and memory cutover](./model-upgrade.md)
before deploying this Worker. Backfill the new Qwen3 index first; upgrade template
models only after the new Worker is live. The old memory index is retained.

Push the shared Prisma schema and seed the default template/skill catalog before
deploying the Worker:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... pnpm --filter=@repo/db db:push
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... pnpm --filter=@repo/db db:seed
```

### 4e. Deploy

```bash
pnpm deploy   # = wrangler deploy
```

The Durable Object + Workflow class migrations (`v1`–`v3` in `wrangler.jsonc`)
apply automatically on first deploy. If you didn't put the custom-domain route
in the config, map `agents.qolmeia.com` to the Worker in the dashboard
(Worker → Settings → Domains & Routes).

## 5. Railway: `apps/api` + Postgres

Build from the repo root with pnpm (it's a workspace). Build: the monorepo
`pnpm build` (or filtered `--filter=api`); start: `node dist/index.mjs`
(listens on `PORT`, default 4000). Create a Postgres service and run the schema:

```bash
pnpm --filter=@repo/db db:push   # against the prod DATABASE_URL
pnpm --filter=@repo/db db:seed   # idempotent product catalog defaults
```

Environment:

| Var                      | Value                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`           | Railway Postgres connection string                      |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`     | `openssl rand -base64 48` (shared with the Next apps)   |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`           | `https://app.qolmeia.com,https://admin.qolmeia.com`     |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN`          | `.qolmeia.com`                                          |
| `AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTS`     | `qolmeia.com,*.qolmeia.com`                             |
| `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`        | `https://app.qolmeia.com,https://admin.qolmeia.com`     |
| `AGENTS_INTERNAL_URL`    | `https://agents.qolmeia.com` (org-create relay target)  |
| `INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET` | MUST match the Worker secret                            |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`         | from Resend                                             |
| `AUTH_FROM_EMAIL`        | `noreply@email.qolmeia.com` (Resend verifies `email.`)  |
| `WEB_APP_URL`            | `https://app.qolmeia.com` (drives `useSecureCookies`)   |
| `NODE_ENV`               | `production` (Better Auth rate limiting is gated on it) |

## 6. Vercel: `apps/web`, `apps/backoffice`, `apps/landing`

Three projects, each with **Root Directory** set to the app folder. Leave the
build and install commands empty: Vercel's monorepo detection installs from the
repo root (pnpm workspaces) and runs `next build` in the root directory. Node
24.x, framework preset Next.js.

Existing projects live in the **`unlockers`** Vercel team as `qolmeia-web`,
`qolmeia-backoffice` and `qolmeia-landing`, mirroring the sibling monorepos
(`frow-web` / `frow-landing`).

`apps/landing` is a static marketing site: no auth, no Prisma, no session. It
needs only two vars:

| Var                       | Value                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_APP_URL` | `https://app.qolmeia.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANDING_URL` | `https://www.qolmeia.com` |

`apps/web` and `apps/backoffice` both construct their own Better Auth instance
in `proxy.ts`, so they need the full cookie configuration, not just the first
four rows:

| Var                      | Value                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`     | same secret as `apps/api`; a mismatch invalidates every session cookie |
| `DATABASE_URL`           | Railway Postgres, `sslmode=require` (see the TLS note below)           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL`   | `https://api.qolmeia.com`                                              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENTS_URL` | `https://agents.qolmeia.com`                                           |
| `WEB_APP_URL`            | `https://app.qolmeia.com`                                              |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN`          | `.qolmeia.com`                                                         |
| `AUTH_ALLOWED_HOSTS`     | `qolmeia.com,*.qolmeia.com`                                            |
| `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`        | `https://app.qolmeia.com,https://admin.qolmeia.com`                    |

The last four are load-bearing and easy to miss:

- **`WEB_APP_URL` is the only input to `useSecureCookies`**
  (`packages/auth/src/env-config.ts`). Unset, or not starting with `https://`,
  and Better Auth issues the cross-subdomain `.qolmeia.com` session cookie
  **without the `Secure` flag**.
- **`COOKIE_DOMAIN` belongs on the Vercel projects too**, not only on Railway.
  `nextCookies()` can write a cookie from a Next server action; without the
  domain that write lands a host-only cookie on `app.qolmeia.com` which shadows
  the parent-domain one.

**Database TLS.** Railway exposes two public endpoints. The **Postgres** one
answers the Postgres `SSLRequest` with `S` (TLS available); the **PgBouncer**
one answers `N` (no TLS). Vercel sits outside Railway's private network, so it
must use the Postgres public URL with `?sslmode=require`. PgBouncer is the right
target only for services running _inside_ Railway, where traffic never leaves
the private network.

Point `www.qolmeia.com` (and the `qolmeia.com` apex) at the landing project,
`app.qolmeia.com` at the web project, and `admin.qolmeia.com` at the backoffice
project in Vercel's domain settings. DNS for `qolmeia.com` is on Cloudflare;
each host needs a CNAME to the value Vercel shows under the project's Domains
tab, or an A record to `216.150.1.1` / `216.150.16.1`.

## 7. Order of operations

For an existing installation, deploy API changes before the Worker, then the Next
apps. Keep existing response fields compatible throughout the rollout. Coverage
options retain string IDs in `disciplines`; the optional `disciplineNames` map
adds display labels without breaking older Workers or backoffice clients.

For the initial setup:

1. **Cloudflare** first; you need `agents.qolmeia.com` for `AGENTS_INTERNAL_URL`.
2. **Railway**: auth + Postgres; gives you `api.qolmeia.com`.
3. **Vercel**: the two Next apps, pointed at both.

`INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` must be **identical** across
the sides that share them. Rotating `INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET` breaks org-create
until both the Worker and `apps/api` are redeployed.

## 8. Smoke test after deploy

1. Sign up / magic-link on `app.qolmeia.com` → cookie set on `.qolmeia.com`.
2. Client onboarding chat (Planner) → confirm a team.
3. Customer chat → Correspondent delegates → a Worker job runs.
4. A gated action lands on `admin.qolmeia.com` `/approvals` → decide it.
5. The approved deliverable appears in the customer chat and `/assets`.

## 9. Still open before "done"

- No CD pipeline: these three deploys are manual.
- An **operator directory** (listing OWNER/STAFF users) doesn't exist yet, so
  the backoffice ships **self-service** coverage; an admin-assigns-others
  surface needs that directory first (ADR 0005 / 0008).
- A staged dependency update (`--latest`) was deferred; do it on its own, not
  bundled with a deploy.
