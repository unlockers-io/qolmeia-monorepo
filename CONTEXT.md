# Qolmeia

An AI marketing agency: each customer company gets a Team of AI agents that does marketing work, with human operators approving sensitive actions before they ship.

## Language

### Actors

**Company**:
A customer tenant. Its id (`companyId`) is the unit of isolation **for the customer surface**: the `/agents/<name>/<companyId>`, `/api/me/*` and `/api/teams/*` paths take `companyId` from the session and never trust it from the URL (ADR 0001). It is also the Durable Object instance id every agent is keyed by. Operators are cross-tenant and reach any Company by role, not by membership (ADR 0005).
_Avoid_: org, tenant, client

**Account**:
A login that belongs to a Company (the `CUSTOMER` role). A Company has one or more Accounts; they all share the Company's surface and agents.
_Avoid_: user, seat

**Customer**:
The role of an Account: an end-user of a Company who chats with its agents. Used for the human; **Account** is the login record. A Customer belongs to exactly one Company, and every request on the customer surface acts in it (ADR 0011).
_Avoid_: user, end user

**Operator**:
Qolmeia platform staff who vet AI prompts and results: the human quality layer, and the product's differentiator. The `OWNER`/`STAFF` members of the single internal **Qolmeia org**; they belong to no customer Company and are authorized by role, acting on any Company through backoffice REST (never an agent connection). The Company acted on comes from the URL; the session only proves the role (ADR 0011). An Operator may have optional assigned Companies and disciplines (ADR 0005).
_Avoid_: admin, moderator, customer

**Assignment**:
The optional link from an Operator to the Companies and disciplines they cover, used to route the approval queue. No assignment means the Operator sees everything.
_Avoid_: scope, permission

**Discipline**:
The kind of work an Action represents (`design`, `copy`, `strategy`, `social`…), derived from the producing agent's `worker_kind`. Routes an Action to the Operator who reviews that craft.
_Avoid_: category, tag, type, skill

### Agents

**Correspondent**:
The single point of contact for a Company, one per Company. Talks to the Customer, delegates specialist work, and presents finished deliverables back in chat.
_Avoid_: assistant, bot, concierge

**Planner**:
The onboarding-interview agent that runs before a Team exists: it debriefs the Company and proposes a Team.
_Avoid_: onboarder, setup agent

**Worker**:
A specialist agent instantiated from a Template (e.g. Designer, Marketing Strategist) that produces a specific kind of deliverable.
_Avoid_: specialist bot, sub-agent

**Team**:
The confirmed set of agents (one Correspondent + its Workers) for a Company. Materialized when the Customer confirms during onboarding.

### Work

**Brief**:
The structured profile of a Company's business: industry, primary goal, audience, channels, and brand (voice, palette, references). Drives what the agents produce; "complete" means all of those are filled. A selected **channel** carries its URL (a bare checkbox without the link is meaningless).
_Avoid_: profile, questionnaire

**Ticket**:
A unit of delegated work the Correspondent hands to a Worker; tracked through `in_progress` → `awaiting_approval` → `done`.
_Avoid_: task, job

**Action**:
A side-effect a Worker proposes (e.g. publish a post). Distinct from a Ticket: the Ticket is the work, the Action is the effect. Its **Policy** decides whether it executes freely, runs-and-notifies, or blocks for an Operator (ADR 0006).
_Avoid_: approval, request

**Deliverable**:
The artifact a Worker produces: a generated image, copy, a research brief. Deliverables `auto-execute` straight to the customer / asset library; only impactful Actions are gated.
_Avoid_: output, result, asset

**Policy**:
The gating tier of an Action, declared per action-type on the producing template: `auto-execute` (runs silently), `notify-only` (runs immediately but surfaces to an Operator feed for spot-check), `require-approval` (blocks until an Operator decides). Only outward, hard-to-reverse Actions get `require-approval`.
_Avoid_: rule, permission, gate

**Decision**:
An Operator's verdict on a gated Action: **approve** (it executes), **reject** (the Ticket ends), or **request-changes** (a revise loop: the feedback returns to the Worker, which regenerates and re-proposes; they iterate until approve or reject). The customer sees only the final approved Deliverable.
_Avoid_: review, vote, outcome

### Storage

**Library**:
A Company's files in R2, split into two **folders**: the **customer folder** (visible to the customer and the agents: finished work + the customer's uploads, including a `brand/` subfolder for brand identity) and the **agent folder** (agent-only working material: scrapes, drafts). An asset's `visibility` (`customer`/`agent`) decides which folder it lives in (ADR 0007).
_Avoid_: assets, files, bucket

**Memory**:
The agent's semantic recall of important facts, saved on purpose with `rememberFact`, retrieved with `recallMemory`, backed by Cloudflare Vectorize. Distinct from the **Library**: a fact is not a file.
_Avoid_: knowledge base, context, RAG
